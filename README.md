## Reflection

This was a long project I used to learn web sockets, and sharpen my React skills. While the project still has a ton of functionality that could be added, I accomplished my goals of the project. I used Socket.IO to create and consume web sockets, to provide real-time collaboration between your peers. I learned a lot about React particularly on how to structure and consume Contexts and Hooks.
